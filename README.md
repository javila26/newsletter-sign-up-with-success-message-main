## Overview

This was the second challenge I made from Frontend Mentor to keep getting better at my design skills because I am looking to become a frontend developer. For this one I just used Html, Css and a bit of JS as they are the foundations of the web development technologies. The concept of the exercise was simple, you have to make a newsletter that after putting your email in it will give a confirmation message saying you have been enrolled for updates from a website.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process
I designed the HTML layout first, I applied the styles for desktop and then resized it with media queries for the mobile version. After having all the interface ready I added the Javascript functionalities.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

I had some troubles passing the email value from the greeting form to the success card component. After making some digging I realized I could achieve that by using session storage which was pretty easy to use. Along the way I stumbled too with LocalStorage but I decided it was not what I was looking for for this exercise.

### Continued development

This is the second exercise I've made for Frontend Mentor, it helped me a lot to better understand the boxing model, I had to toy a lot margin and padding to really understand what I was doing and how position everything in a away that matched the picture references.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [W3Schools CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - Having always a bit code to mess with and make sure of understanding a property comes very handy.
